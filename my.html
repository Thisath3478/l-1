<b><h1>Christmas</h1></b>
<br><p>Christmas is a beautiful festival celebrated every year on 25th December to honour the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a time for joy, family, and spreading kindness. 
    People prepare for Christmas by decorating their homes with lights, colourful ornaments, and a sparkling Christmas tree. 
    Families come together to share delicious meals and exchange thoughtful gifts. Children eagerly look forward to Santa Claus, who is believed to bring presents and spread happiness.
    Churches hold special prayers and carol singing, reminding everyone of the values of peace, love, and generosity. Christmas is not just about celebrations; 
    it also teaches us the importance of helping others and sharing what we have with those in need. The festival brings warmth to hearts, lights to homes, and hope for the future. 
    It is a day to cherish togetherness, create beautiful memories, and fill the world with love and joy.</p>
